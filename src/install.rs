pub const APG_UPGRADE_DOC: &str = r#"# apg layout upgrades — the `apg/config.json` version field

This guide is installed by `apg init` at `~/.opencode/lib/apg-upgrade.md`;
the version gate's block text points here.

## What the `version` field is

`apg/config.json` (the committed layout config at the repo root) carries a
**binary-managed `version` field** — for example `"version": "0.10.4"`. It
records which apg binary last initialized or upgraded the layout. It is not a
user setting: `apg init` owns it. Your `default` / `types` (code_type rules)
are yours; the `version` field is the binary's — never hand-edit it.

## What checks it

The layout-touching operations — `apg scan` and `apg project start` —
**block, they never warn**, unless the layout's declared version shares the
running binary's **major.minor** (patch versions never matter):

| apg/config.json `version` | apg 0.10.4 verdict |
|---|---|
| same major.minor (`0.10.0` … `0.10.99`) | proceed (patch diff is fine) |
| missing `version` field (pre-versioning layout) | **block** |
| older major.minor (`0.9.x`, `0.8.x`, …) | **block** — upgrade the layout |
| newer major.minor (`0.11.x`, `1.x`, …) | **block** — upgrade the binary |

`apg init` is the upgrade act: it re-runs idempotently, writes the current
version, and scaffolds the layout. `apg init` is also the layout entry point —
a repo never created by `apg init` has no versioned layout at all.

## Upgrade steps

1. Re-run **`apg init`** from the repo root. It is idempotent: writes the
   current binary version into `apg/config.json` (your code_type rules are
   untouched), scaffolds `apg/.worktrees/` + the `.gitignore` entries
   (`apg/.trans/`, `apg/.worktrees/`), and installs/updates the opencode apg
   suite (tools, agents, this guide).
2. Re-run the blocked command: `apg scan`, or `apg project start <name>`.
3. **Layout newer than the binary** (the block text says so): upgrade apg
   first — `brew upgrade apg` (or the matching frontend formulae), the
   `install.sh` installer, or a newer release — then `apg init`, then re-run
   the blocked command.

## Common issues

- **"declares no layout version"** — the layout predates layout versioning,
  or was created without `apg init` (an old `apg scan` created only
  `apg/.trans/`). Fix: `apg init` writes the field.
- **"not a valid version"** — the field was hand-edited into something
  unparseable. Fix: `apg init` rewrites it.
- **"config.json does not exist"** — no versioned layout here yet. Fix:
  `apg init` (the layout entry point), then re-run.
- **Worktree scaffolding missing** — `apg init` scaffolds `apg/.worktrees/`
  and its `.gitignore` entry; `apg project start` also self-heals both when
  absent, so this resolves itself on the next start.
- **Code_type rules look reformatted** — the JSON file is rewritten when the
  version changes; the rules' *content* is preserved (only whitespace/field
  order may normalize). Never re-add the version by hand afterwards — re-run
  `apg init`.
