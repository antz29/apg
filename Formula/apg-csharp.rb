# C# scanner frontend for apg. Publishes the Roslyn-based scanner as a
# self-contained single-file binary and drops it into the shared frontends dir
# the `scanner` formula's bin/apg wrapper points at. Needs a .NET SDK at build
# time; the published binary is self-contained (no runtime dependency).
