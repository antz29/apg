# TypeScript scanner frontend for apg. Runs `npm ci` in src/tslib (the official
# TypeScript compiler) and drops the scanner + its node_modules into the shared
# frontends dir the `scanner` formula's bin/apg wrapper points at. Needs `node`
# on PATH at scan time; a repo's node_modules is always skipped, and
# workspace-package imports resolve even before `npm install`.
