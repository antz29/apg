# Python scanner frontend for apg. Builds the pyfrontend binary and drops it
# into the shared frontends dir the `scanner` formula's bin/apg wrapper points
# at. Requires a current stable Rust toolchain and network at build time to
# fetch the pinned Ruff/ty engine crates. Scanning itself needs NO Python
# runtime: the frontend resolves from filesystem markers (pyproject.toml /
# uv.lock / pyvenv.cfg) and never shells out to `python`/`uv`.
