# Rust scanner frontend for apg. Builds the rustfrontend binary and drops it
# into the shared frontends dir the `scanner` formula's bin/apg wrapper points
# at. Requires a current stable Rust toolchain (rust-analyzer tracks the newest
# stable) and network at build time to fetch the pinned rust-analyzer crates.
